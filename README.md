Lab 5: Creating IAM Policies
This lab guides you through the process of creating IAM policies for various AWS services, including DynamoDB, S3, and EC2.
An entity that establishes the permissions for an identity or resource is called a policy. To build customer-controlled policies in IAM, you can utilize the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS API.
